My First GitHub Repository for Practice --
========================================================
I am a new, aspiring data scientist with a background in data modeling the old-fashioned way. I feel fairly comfortable with creating models, but still new to programming which I have discovered I LOVE!
I am hoping to gain more programming experience with the help of this site and the guidance of a much more experienced and smart friend who told me about this site. (Thanks, Rob Jasper!)
I am incredibily excited to be here and hope to learn more about this community and eventually be a contributing member!
