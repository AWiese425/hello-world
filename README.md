# hello-world
My First GitHub Repository for Practice --
========================================================
I am a new, aspiring data scientist with a background in economic analysis and data modeling support the old-fashioned way. I feel fair to middling in the stats and math of data science but, always feel I can improve and so continue to train myself in that area.
I am still new to programming which I have discovered I am having a lot of fun learning and hope to continue to progress in!
I am hoping to gain more programming experience with the help of this site and the guidance of a much more experienced and smart friend who told me about this site. (Thanks, Rob Jasper!)
I am incredibily excited to be here and hope to learn more about this community and eventually be a contributing member!
